# o-my-cute-app

This is yet *another* app...

The plan is make my pc as a game console. Cellphone (as many) can be like a wii remote thingy.

Now it contains a websocket server and a react native android client. Gonna has a unity3d as a view to the server soon.

It is cute since it's tiny... and snab as I promised!!!
